# WEB APPS:

<details open>
<summary>
General Info
</summary>

### General Info:
Separate web application frontends written in `AngularJS`/`GoogleMapsJS`.  

In future work we aim to migrate to: `Leaflet`/`VueJS`.  

All web apps [share](./shared/) some resources:
```
shared
├── css
├── images
└── js/
    └── anyplace-core-js
```

All current web apps are built into the generated `Play` package.  
In the future, we will bundle the backend (`/api` + `/developers`) separately than the front-ends
to significantly reduce development/testing time.

The back-end service will run on a dedicated port.

</details>

### Current Web Apps:
1. [architect](./anyplace_architect): `AngularJS` + `Grunt`
2. [viewer](./anyplace_viewer): `AngularJS` + `Grunt`
3. [viewer_campus](./anyplace_viewer_campus): `AngularJS` + `Grunt`
4. [developers](./developers): `sbt-play-swagger` + `swagger-ui`

Show Compilation Instructions
</summary>

0. Install dependency tools

Sample commands on ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo apt install node-grunt-cli
```


1. `cd` to the relevant web app directory

2. Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) dependencies:
```
bower install
```

3. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks (requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)):

```
# For Unix:
npm install
# For Windows:
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
4. Build the web app:

4.1 Development Version:
```
# grunt will keep 'watching' for resource updates (js/css/images)
grunt
```
4.1 Deployment version:
```
grunt deploy
```
For windows: use `grunt.cmd`


### The built files will be in the *build* folder with the following structure:
```
    <web-app>
    ├── build
    │   ├── css
    │   │   └── anyplace.min.css  # Concatenated and minified CSS
    │   ├── images
    │   │   └── ...               # Optimized images
    │   └── js
    │       └── anyplace.min.js   # Concatenated and minified JS files
    ├── bower_components
    │   └── ...                   # Bower dependencies
    └── index.html
```

#### Older notes on deploying the HTML:
Once the *build* folder is ready, we need to access the index.html file through the http protocol.
An easy way to do that is to start a Python [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) in the directory were the index.html is located.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```

Then hit *http://localhost:9000/* in your browser to launch AnyplaceArchitect.

(The index.html file cannot be simply opened through the file system because the browser will throw security errors.)

**The port number is important**.
For security purposes, AnyplaceServer accepts Cross-Origin requests from *localhost* only on ports 3030, 8080 and 9000.
